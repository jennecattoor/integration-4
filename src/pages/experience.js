            <hr />
            <p>To raise awareness around spiking, we have made a full body VR-installation where you will experience the symptoms of GHB spiking, comparable to a drunk driving simulation. During this experience thereâ€™s a supervisor present and you can stop anytime you want.  Check below where we are right now and where we will be standing in the future.</p>
