# A school project

## Team
For this project 2 Devine students (Matthias and Jenne) worked together with 2 CMD students from Rotterdam (Nikki & Willemijn). Together we had 5 weeks to finish this project.

## Briefing
"Design a digital solution that addresses socially unsafe situations and practices that occur in (urban) society. You have to focus on the Rotterdam."

## Our idea
We decided to tackle the spiking problem. With new forms of spiking (needle spiking) on the horizon we wanted to act quick.

## Result
We made a spiking simulator and a supportive website with the goal to make people more aware about the problem.
